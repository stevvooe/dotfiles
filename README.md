Dotfiles for stevvooe

## Cloning the Repository

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:stevvooe/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
```

## Getting Started

Ideally, once the repository is cloned, you can just run make:

```
make
```

The goal is such that every time `make` is run, the entire system will be
reapplied. However, that might take some effort to maintain efficiently.
