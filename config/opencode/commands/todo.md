Append the following item to the `TODO.md` file in the project root. Create the file if it doesn't exist.

Add it as a bullet point with a `- [ ]` checkbox prefix. Do not modify or reorganize existing items. Just append.

Item to add:

$ARGUMENTS

Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as literal text. If it contains newlines or tabs, collapse them to spaces and append a single line only.
